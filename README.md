# Weather_Forcast 

This was a project in which I wanted get my hands dirty with APIs. I've programmed quite a bit in the past, and
haven't ever had the opportunity to really work with other companies' data before. It's a fairly simple application,
however, I think it shows a good foundation in Python, as well as other methods for obtaining data for future use.
